      <h1>Hi there, I'm Sumin Shrestha</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Hello Everyone, my name is Sumin Shrestha. I am from Nepal where I
            finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information
            Technology from Tribhuvan University. After completion of my
            bachelor degree, I worked as a front-end web developer in an IT
            company. While working there, I got quite familiar with the working
            environment and got to expand my knowledge on web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In future, I would like to be a character animator or a game
            designer so that I will be able to make my interest into my career
            and include my knowledge of testing to that. I come from a small
            family there are just five of us. Me, my father and mother, my
            brother and our little sister. Also, my dog (Haru) who is quite
            fidgety and had destroyed most of our clothes but still we love him.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to cook and sometimes try to make new dishes. In my free
            time, I usually like to sketch and do some illustrations while
            listening to music like classical ones or K-pop. If you like to see
            my artwork, check up my Instagram

          <p>
            My trengths come from my family and friends who encourage me to do
            new things and support me in every situation and my weakness is I
            get quite nervous to speak in front of a large audiences. So, I also
            want to improve my communication skills and be able to read my
            audiences.
